# Document-Clustering
Document Clustering by Fuzzy C Mean


By using Fuzzy C Mean I cluster the train data among Resume, Application and Other(Other include documents like lyrics, story, poem etc)
After Clustering I use the user Document and find it's belongingness w.r.t Resume, Application or Other clusters, and after determining it I move the Document to a Directory In respect of it's cluster.
