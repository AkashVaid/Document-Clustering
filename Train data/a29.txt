Application for Fee Concession
To
The principal
ABC School,
Dear Madam,
I am a very hardworking student of grade 9 at your school. I have passed all my exams with highest marks on class. My overall result shows that I am a hardworking and devoted student who is very passionate about studies.However, currently, I have been going through financial crisis at my home. My father is a retired officer and my brother’s earnings are not too high. I do not want to get expelled by not submitting my fee. I am very keen and eager to get higher studies, so I request you to grant me fee concession so that I can continue my studies.
I would be highly grateful to you for this kind act.
Thank you
Yours Faithfully
XYZ
