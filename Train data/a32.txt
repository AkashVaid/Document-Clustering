Application for Fee Concession Due to Father’s Death
The Dean.
Department_______
Institute__________
Subject:  For Fee Concession
Respected Sir,
It is stated that I am student of _________ department in ______ year and my registration number is___________. I want to say that I belong to a poor family, my father was the only earner of our family but he was a heart patient. Unfortunately, he died in the last week.
It is such a crucial and dreadful time on our family. We are 5 siblings and all are School / College going. All are getting education on scholarships. My educational expenses were afforded by my father as he wanted all of us to be at a higher level. His death is a big loss of ours.
Next week fee for new semester is to be submitted. I am not able to afford my fee, but I am a sharp and intelligent student, I want to continue my studies as I have secured good grades every time. I want you to kindly grant me full fee concession. It would be a lifetime favour for me. I shall be highly obliged to you.
Hope that you’ll consider my request.
 
Yours obediently,
Name: ________
Date:___________
