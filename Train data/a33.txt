Application for Fee Concession to Principal of School
To,
The Principal,
____ School Lahore
Subject: Request for Fee Concession
Dear Madam,
I _______ am studying in Class ______ . I am good in studies as I stood first in the whole session. I want to put a request before you. My father gets a small salary and we live in a backward area of Lahore. He is not able to pay my school fee as most often much is spent on dropping me at school and mine campus is quite far away. My father alone manages me and my two brothers and he left with small amount to live with.
Therefore, I request you to grant me full fee concession. I shall be grateful to you for this help.
Yours Obediently,
