Subject: Application for Fee Concession
Respected Sir,
It is stated that I am Ravi Mehra and I have joined in Diploma of Office Management in your esteemed organization. This is to inform you that I saw the fee concession notice for deserving student on notice board and I am writing on account of that. Sir, I am deserving student and my father expired in an accident. My mother is lone member to manage all the study and other expenses of my family. I am not only one to study, my three siblings are also school going. I want to request for full fee concession as I have already paid registration fee. I hope that you will consider my request.
Thanking you.
Yours Obediently,
Ravi Mehra.
