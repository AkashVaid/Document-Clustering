To,

Punjab College,

Respected Madam,
With due respect, It is stated that, I am a student of first year in your college. My father works in a factory as a labour. Our income is very sufficient and we are five siblings all are getting education. My father can not bear my college expense.
Dear Mam, I can not continue my studies further without some sort of fee concession. It is evident from my academic record, that I am one of the most brilliant student of my class. I am very fond of education. Please grant me a full fee concession so, I could continue my education.
Yours Obediently,
