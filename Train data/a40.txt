Subject: Application for Sick Leave for Student
Respected Madam,
It is kindly stated that due to a sudden illness I will not be able to attend school for a few days. I request you to grant me leave for the days that I will miss. I hope to recover soon and make up for the lost work. I shall return to school as a healthy student and take due care that my work or performance does not suffer.
Yours Obediently,
