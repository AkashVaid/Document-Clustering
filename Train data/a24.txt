Respected Madam,

3-Benton Robert (Grade 5)
4-Aliha Robert(Grade 4)
I am paying full fee of my three children only one child  is 50% off. It is requested that due to some financial crises I am not able to afford this much fee, so Kindly provide fee concession of other child upto 50% at least. So, that all of them can study at single satisfactory place. I shall be very thankful to you for your kind favour.
Thanking in anticipation
Yours Truly,
Anthony Robert
