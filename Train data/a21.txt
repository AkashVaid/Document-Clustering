To 
The Principal
Delhi Public school
New Delhi



Respected Sir,

                Subject: Request for fee concession.

                My son, Mahesh Madan, is a student of your school. He is very brilliant and has been doing very well in his studies. We want him to continue his studies in your school. But I do not have a very high salaried job. It is difficult for me to pay his monthly fee which is very high for me.

                I do not want this to be an obstacle in his academic life. I humbly request you to grant a fee concession to him as he is a good student. I shall be very grateful to you for this favour.

 

Yours Sincerely

Mr. Mehrotra
