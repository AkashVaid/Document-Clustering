Sample Application for Fee Concession in University
The Principal,
Institute __________.
Subject:  For Fee Concession
Sir,
With due respect it is stated that I am _________ (name) studying in ________ ( department ).I want to say that I belong to a poor family and I am unable to pay my college fee and funds. I am a sharp and intelligent student and I was on merit in this college.
I also applied for scholarship but all in vain. I along with my siblings are six, all are school/college going. I am elder among them. Being a girl I am not able to meet my educational needs, my father is the only working person and he have to feed eight members of our home.
Having good grades is the thing I am proud at and due to family constraints I shall not be able to continue my studies. It would be a great loss of mine. I don’t want to waste my knowledge. Kindly, grant me full fee concession so that I might be able to continue my studies without being a burden on anyone. I hope that you’ll consider my request.
I shall be highly obliged to you.
Thanking you I remain.
Yours obediently,
Name: ________
Date:___________
