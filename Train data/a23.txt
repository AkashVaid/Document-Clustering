Subject: Requesting principal for fee discount
Respected Sir,
With due respect, it is to state that my father is bed ridden
due to severe back pain and hence unable to go on his job as earlier. His disease upsets us all and my study is suffering utmost. Please give me discount in fee for the next semester just and in the mean while my father will come back to his feet again, but until then cooperate with us in this hour of need. Thanking in anticipation.
Yours Truly,
Mr. Raam Laal,
6 th November, 2017.
