Respected Sir,
It is stated that I am Asma Haider, student of BS. Computer Sciences Semester 3rd in this University and my registration number is Comp-190. It is to inform that I am suffering from stomach problem since last two days, I have severe constipation along with pain that even I cannot stand up. I really have a critical condition. As suggested by my Doctor, I need to be admitted in the hospital until I recover.
In this condition of mine I am not able to come to University and attend classes. I understand that finals are nearby but I will cover up the syllabus soon.  I request you to kindly, grant me leave for a week from 3rd Sep to 10th September 2014. Your kind consideration is required.
Thanking You I remain,
Yours Obediently,
Asma Haider.
