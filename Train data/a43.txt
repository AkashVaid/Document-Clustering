Subject: Application for Sick Leave
Respected Ma’am,
I beg to state with due respect that I am not able to come to school tomorrow as I am feeling really drowsy. Doctor has identified low blood sugar level in me and to properly get treatment I need to visit hospital tomorrow. Because of this situation I request you to please grant me leave for a day. I shall be very grateful to you.
Yours Obediently,
Sarah
