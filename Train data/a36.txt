The Principal,

Sir,
With due respect it is stated that I am Sana Basheer and I am selected in your college on merit basis. I have scored 95% marks in the test conducted by the college management. Sir, I am hardworking student and I assure you that I will study with great competence. I belong to a poor family and am not able to pay the dues for registration and annual fee. I request you to grant me fee concession, it would be a huge favor and I shall be grateful to you for this act of kindness.
Thanking You.
Yours obediently,
Sana Basheer.
