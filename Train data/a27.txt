Sample Application for Fee Concession
To,
The Principal,
The Darwin College,
Kualalampur, Malaysia.
Subject: Application for fee discount
Respected Madam,
I am writing to request you to be compassionate and offer me a fee discount since even after installments the dues are not manageable for me. I belong to a humble family that does not have plenty of resources at their disposal and have many other commitments already. My brother is the sole bread earner for my family and my father is gravely ill. With many mouths to feed and an illness to attend to my dues is an added trouble.
I have the spirit and the drive to summit new heights and I do not wish money to be an inconvenient factor in my life. If however you grant me a discount on the fees I will be able to achieve my dreams and will be forever grateful for this kindness.
Yours Truly,
Mr. Jamshed Rizvi
