Sick Leave Application from Parents
To,
The Principal,
Elite School
Karachi, Pakistan.
Subject: Sick leave application by parents
Respected Sir,
Please be informed that our son who attends your school for grade eight has been down with fever for the last two days and requires leave from school to recover. The doctors believe he is suffering from common cold and flu but since it is contagious he should stay at home and rebuild his strength. He already suffers from low immunity. We are aware of the school policy that he cannot avail leave from school beyond a certain limit and he is already at the margin. It is an unavoidable absence and we request your
collaboration.
We shall try to take all measures to help him regain health soon. We would be grateful if his teachers could cooperate and inform us the lessons he will be missing or has missed already. We do not want his absence from school to be an excuse for poor results.
Yours Truly,
Mr. Faiz Aleem
3 rd November, 2015.
