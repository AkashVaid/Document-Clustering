Sick Leave Application Sample for Students
The Principal,
Wilson Elementary High School,
London, United Kingdom.
Subject: Application for Sick Leave for Student
Reverent Sir,
With due honor and respect, I would like to state the reason of writing this application to you. I am mother of Mr. David who is recently admitted here in 1 st year. It is his nature that he had developed a sort of Exam Fever and to a greater extent that even doctor feels himself helpless as what to do with this case!
In the school, exams are approaching fast and near; and David had developed his mania! He is good in studies but before each exam he needs psychological assistant and for that reason I want a leave till his first paper. All the requisite documents are attached with this application for your kind review. Thank you.
Yours Truly,
Ms. Liza Ferns.
