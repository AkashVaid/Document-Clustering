To 
The Principal
Dashmesh Public school
New Ashok Nagar



Respected Sir,

                Subject: Request for fee concession.

                My Daughter, Rina Kumari Madan, is a student of your school. She is very brilliant and has been doing very well in his studies. We want him to continue her studies in your school. But I do not have a very high salaried job. It is difficult for me to pay his monthly fee which is very high for me.

                I do not want this to be an obstacle in her academic life. I humbly request you to grant a fee concession to her as she is a good student. I shall be very grateful to you for this favour.

 

Yours Sincerely

Satish Kumar Mehrotra
